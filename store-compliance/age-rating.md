## Recommended Age Rating: 12+

### Rationale

The app displays classical literature from various historical periods. While the app itself contains no objectionable content, some literary passages may:

- Discuss mature themes (war, death, religious concepts)
- Contain language or views that were common historically but may be considered outdated
- Include references to violence or romantic themes in the context of classic literature

This is educational content similar to what would be found in a school literature curriculum.
